# Install a Solace Message Router onto a Google Compute Engine Linux Virtual Machine

The Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities deployable in any computing environment. The VMR provides the same rich feature set as Solaceâ€™s proven hardware appliances, with the same open protocol support, APIs and common management. The VMR can be deployed in the datacenter or natively within all popular private and public clouds.

# How to Deploy a VMR
This is a 3 step process:

* Go to the Solace Developer portal and request a Solace Community edition VMR (or the Evaluation edition, if you want to set-up an HA group). This process will return an email with a Download link. Do a right click "Copy Hyperlink" on the "Download the VMR Community Edition for Docker" (or Evaluation Edition) hyperlink.  This link is of the form "http<nolink>://em.solace.com ?" will be needed in the following section.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianHoltfurth/solace-gcp-quickstart/container-optimized-os/images/register.png"/>
    
</a>

* Go to your Google Cloud Platform console and create a Compute Engine instance.  Ensure at least 2 vCPU and 4 GB of memory, a Container Optimized OS, and a disk with a
size of at least 30 GB depolyed on COS:

* Expand the the Management tab to expose the Automation Startup script panel

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianHoltfurth/solace-gcp-quickstart/container-optimized-os/images/gce_launch_cos_2.png "GCE Image creation 2")

Cut and paste the code into the panel, replace -link to VMR Docker Image- with the URL you received in step one.

* If you are configuring 3 HA nodes, expand the the Network tab to edit the Network interface panel and customise your IP addresses. You need to pick 3 available IPs (same as you configure in your start-up script)

Now hit the "Create" button on the bottom of this page or add some VMR config keys before you do.

# Initializing config keys with Cloud-Init
You can use VMR configuration keys to initialise your VMR. All keys introduced with v8.4 are supported except for service_semp_port, username&lowbar;&lt;name&gt;&lowbar;... and interface&lowbar;&lt;ip&lowbar;intf&gt;&lowbar;. . .
see [Initializing-Config-Keys-With-Cloud-Init]( http://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/Initializing-Config-Keys-With-Cloud-Init.htm) for a full list.  
To initialise your VMR with HA group configuration, set the additional variable baseroutername to the base name of your choosing for all 3 VMRs and follow the following naming convention for your VMRs (and config keys).
- monitor node = ${baseroutername}0
- primary node = ${baseroutername}1
- backup node  = ${baseroutername}2

[All router names need to be based on the baseroutername followed by an index of 0, 1 or 2 as suffix]  
Please note that dashes or underscores are not allowed in your baseroutername or routername and the script will fail to find your config-keys, if you attempt to use them in your names!

Now hit the "Create" button on the bottom of this page. This will start the process of starting the GCE instance, installing Docker and finally download and install the VMR.  It is possible to access the VM before the entire Solace solution is up.  You can monitor /var/lib/solace/install.log for the following entry: "'date' INFO: Install is complete" to indicate when the install has completed.

# Set up network security to allow access
Now that the VMR is instantiated, the network security firewall rule needs to be set up to allow access to both the admin application and data traffic.  Under the "Networking -> VPC network -> Firewall rules" tab add a new rule to your project exposing the required ports:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/images/gce_network.png "GCE Firewall rules")
`tcp:80;tcp:8080;tcp:1883;tcp:8000;tcp:9000;tcp:55003;tcp:55555`

For more information on the ports required for the message router see the [configuration defaults](http://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/VMR-Configuration-Defaults.htm)
. For more information on Google Cloud Platform Firewall rules see [Networking and Firewalls](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls)

# Gaining admin access to the VMR

For persons used to working with Solace message router console access, this is still available with the google compute engine instance.  Access the web ssh terminal window by clicking the [ssh] button next to your VMR instance,  then launch a SolOS cli session:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/images/gce_console.png "GCE console with SolOS cli")
`sudo docker exec -it solace /usr/sw/loads/currentload/bin/cli -A`

For persons who are unfamiliar with the Solace mesage router or would prefer an administration application the SolAdmin management application is available.  For more information on SolAdmin see the [SolAdmin page](http://dev.solace.com/tech/soladmin/).  To get SolAdmin, visit the Solace [download page](http://dev.solace.com/downloads/) and select OS version desired.  Management IP will be the Public IP associated with youe GCE instance and port will be 8080 by default.

# Testing data access to the VMR

To test data traffic though the newly created VMR instance, visit the Solace developer portal and and select your preferred programming langauge to [send and receive messages](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/send-receive-messages/). Under each language there is a Publish/Subscribe tutorial that will help you get started.
